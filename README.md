# Data Analytics Learning Repository

This repository documents my ongoing journey in Data Analytics. I’m building practical skills step by step across core tools and technologies used in real-world analytics workflows. The goal of this repo is to track my progress, store practice files, and share small projects and exercises as I continue learning.

## What I’m Learning

### Excel
- Data cleaning and formatting  
- Formulas and functions (lookup, logical, text, date functions)  
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts  
- Dashboards and reports  
- Data validation and conditional formatting  

### SQL
- Basic to advanced queries  
- Filtering, sorting, and grouping data  
- Joins and subqueries  
- Window functions  
- Aggregations and reporting queries  
- Practice datasets and query exercises  

### Python for Data Analytics
- Core Python concepts for data work  
- Working with datasets and files  
- Data manipulation and transformation  

#### Libraries I’m Using
- Pandas — data analysis and manipulation  
- NumPy — numerical operations  
- Matplotlib — basic visualizations  
- Seaborn — statistical charts  
- Jupyter Notebook — analysis workflow  

### Power BI
- Data modeling  
- Power Query transformations  
- DAX basics  
- Interactive dashboards  
- Visual storytelling with data  

## Repository Structure

- `/excel` — practice sheets, dashboards, and exercises  
- `/sql` — query practice and database exercises  
- `/python` — notebooks and scripts  
- `/powerbi` — reports and dashboard files  
- `/datasets` — sample datasets used for practice  

## Purpose

This is a learning-focused repository. Most of the content is practice-based and will keep improving over time as I learn more advanced concepts and apply them in mini projects.

## Progress Approach

I focus on:
- Practicing with real or sample datasets  
- Writing clean and readable queries/code  
- Building small dashboards and reports  
- Revisiting topics to strengthen fundamentals  

## Notes

Suggestions and feedback are always welcome. This repo will continue to grow as I expand my skills in Data Analytics.
